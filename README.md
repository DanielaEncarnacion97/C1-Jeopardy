# Capital One - Summit Challenge 2019:

A interactive trivia based on Jeopardy clues, utilizing the JServiceIO API. 

## Challenge: 
Utilizing unfamiliar technologies, I had to become acquainted with various new concepts, languages, and frameworks while building the functionality for a front and back-end web application. 

## Tech/Frameworks Used: 
Bootstrap
HTML5, CSS, Jquery/Javascript 
POSTMAN,
Python
Flask w/ Jinja Templating

## Concepts Learned: 
1. How to access an API using POSTMAN 
2. How to create a front-end and connect it to backend operations using Flask and Jinja. 
3. Jquery ajax functions to retrieve API data
4. Learned about JSON document response

## Conclusion: 
This experience has gave me the confidence to believe that I am capable of building a web application without being exposed to technologies that were required in order for this to be possible. I am so excited and proud of the work Capital One has pushed me to do because these are not the types of projects your are introduced to in universities.
